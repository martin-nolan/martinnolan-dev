# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive refactoring and cleanup of the Martin Nolan Portfolio codebase. The project aims to eliminate technical debt, remove unused code, consolidate environment management, improve code organization, and enhance maintainability while preserving all existing functionality. The refactoring will modernize the codebase structure, improve developer experience, and ensure production readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File System Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary files and reduce clutter, so that the repository is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing legacy documentation files THEN the system SHALL remove CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and other outdated documentation files
2. WHEN auditing environment files THEN the system SHALL consolidate to only essential .env files (.env.example, .env.local for development)
3. WHEN examining configuration files THEN the system SHALL remove unused scripts, configs, and build artifacts
4. WHEN cleaning up root directory THEN the system SHALL maintain only actively used configuration files

### Requirement 2: Dead Code Detection and Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove unused code, so that the codebase is lean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running static analysis tools THEN the system SHALL identify unused TypeScript/JavaScript files using ts-prune
2. WHEN analyzing component usage THEN the system SHALL detect orphaned components in src/features/, src/widgets/, and src/shared/
3. WHEN reviewing exports THEN the system SHALL remove unused exports, interfaces, and legacy logic
4. WHEN checking imports THEN the system SHALL eliminate unused import statements and dependencies
5. WHEN validating API routes THEN the system SHALL remove unused API endpoints

### Requirement 3: Environment Management Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized environment variable management, so that configuration is consistent and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing environment variables THEN the system SHALL create a centralized env utility in src/shared/lib/env.ts
2. WHEN validating environment variables THEN the system SHALL remove duplicated validation patterns across the codebase
3. WHEN updating .env.example THEN the system SHALL ensure it matches all required keys without extras
4. WHEN checking environment usage THEN the system SHALL replace direct process.env access with centralized utilities

### Requirement 4: Common Logic Centralization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared functionality centralized, so that code reuse is maximized and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying modal/scroll logic THEN the system SHALL move reusable hooks to src/shared/hooks/
2. WHEN organizing types THEN the system SHALL ensure all interfaces live in src/shared/types/
3. WHEN reviewing utility functions THEN the system SHALL consolidate duplicate utilities
4. WHEN examining component patterns THEN the system SHALL extract reusable patterns to shared components

### Requirement 5: Import and API Route Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean imports and optimized API routes, so that the application loads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing imports THEN the system SHALL remove unused API routes and components
2. WHEN checking hardcoded values THEN the system SHALL replace hardcoded URLs with environment/config imports
3. WHEN optimizing bundle size THEN the system SHALL ensure proper dynamic imports for client-side code
4. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate all routes are actively used

### Requirement 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running type checking THEN the system SHALL pass npm run typecheck without errors
2. WHEN running linting THEN the system SHALL pass npm run lint without violations
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL complete npm run build successfully
4. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL verify all features work as before refactoring

### Requirement 7: Design System and Accessibility Audit

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent design and accessibility, so that the portfolio is professional and inclusive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing styling THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent use of Tailwind/shadcn without direct style overrides
2. WHEN checking accessibility THEN the system SHALL verify ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation in components
3. WHEN auditing UI components THEN the system SHALL ensure proper semantic HTML structure
4. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL verify mobile-first approach is maintained

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Architecture Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and architecture overview, so that the project is easy to understand and contribute to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating README.md THEN the system SHALL include a clear architecture diagram and setup instructions
2. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL remove outdated migration guides and legacy notes
3. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL document the new centralized patterns and utilities
4. WHEN explaining architecture THEN the system SHALL provide clear folder structure and naming conventions
