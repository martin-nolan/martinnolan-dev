# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The martinnolan-dev Next.js project builds successfully on Netlify but crashes at runtime with a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getInitialProps')` error in the main bundle. The application works perfectly in local development but fails in production deployment. This spec addresses the need to diagnose and resolve the deployment-specific runtime error while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the getInitialProps runtime error, so that I can understand why the production build behaves differently from local development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console logging is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide detailed runtime debugging information accessible through browser dev tools in production
2. WHEN the Next.js configuration is reviewed THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with Netlify's serverless function environment
3. WHEN the getInitialProps usage is audited THEN the system SHALL identify any components or pages that might be causing the undefined reference
4. IF custom \_app.tsx or \_document.tsx files exist THEN the system SHALL verify their compatibility with Netlify's rendering environment
5. WHEN client-side error tracking is added THEN the system SHALL capture and log runtime errors for debugging without requiring server access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the Netlify-specific runtime configuration issues, so that the deployed application runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Netlify build settings are configured THEN the system SHALL use the correct Node.js version and build commands for Next.js 14.2.32
2. WHEN serverless function compatibility is addressed THEN the system SHALL ensure getInitialProps works correctly in Netlify's function environment
3. IF static generation warnings exist THEN the system SHALL resolve the "TT: undefined function: 32" warning
4. WHEN deployment configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure proper handling of Next.js server-side rendering on Netlify

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and fallbacks, so that the application gracefully handles any remaining edge cases in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages instead of crashing
2. WHEN getInitialProps fails THEN the system SHALL have appropriate fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL verify all required dependencies are properly bundled
4. IF server-side rendering fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to client-side rendering where appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate the fix across different deployment scenarios, so that I can ensure the solution is robust and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fix is deployed THEN the system SHALL successfully render all pages without runtime errors
2. WHEN the application is tested THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality from local development
3. WHEN build logs are reviewed THEN the system SHALL show no critical warnings or errors
4. WHEN the site is accessed THEN the system SHALL load correctly across different browsers and devices
